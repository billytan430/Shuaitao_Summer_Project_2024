## Project



Welcome to my project repository for the comprehensive algorithmic trading course I'm following on YouTube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y3yaoi9rUQ&t=7556s). This course covers three advanced trading strategies.
I focused on learning the basic intergration of implementing the unsupervised learing strategy for stock in this project! 

### Unsupervised Learning Trading Strategy
#### Objective: Utilize S&P 500 stocks data to master features, indicators, and portfolio optimization.
#### Tools: Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas
#### Description: This module focuses on applying unsupervised learning techniques to identify patterns and optimize portfolios using historical data of S&P 500 stocks using Sharpe Ratio.


What I did beyond the video: creation of sp500 sql database. 


To go beyond & what to look for in my next project: Algorithm Trading

* I want to use more web scarping techiniques to conduct more thoroough sentiment analsis
* More complicated models in terms of machine learning techniques ( validation focused because i realized i had a 600% return :-) )
* To include Nasdaq stocks to go beyond just sp500
* Generate more features, and then cluster features by category, -> better portfolio
